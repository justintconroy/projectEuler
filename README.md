About this Repository
=====================

I am creating this repository to hold all of my work as I go through the
problems on Project Euler. The repository is broken down into
sub-directories which each contain one of the problems found at
[the problems page of Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems).
Each of those subdirectories will contain other sub-directories for each
language used to solve that problem, as well as a README.md describing
that problem.

About Project Euler
===================

What is Project Euler?
----------------------

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant
and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will
be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to
provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas
and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
